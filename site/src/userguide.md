## Overview

Junder is a static code analysis tool that works on JVM class files. 

You give it a list of folders or a list of jars that you would like to analyse. The idea is that you give it only your jars, not the jars of third parties.  This means the analysis is done on your code only, not the entire application.

Most likely you would use the **classes folder** that is used by your build  or development tool as input. In such a set-up, you would run Junder after an Eclipse build. 

You give the input in a [properties file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties).  The name of the property is `inputPaths`.  The file itself can contain other properties as well; so you can add an entry to an existing properties file if you like.

## A quick tutorial

For this quick tutorial, we run Junder using itself as input.  So, you would have to download the source (or clone the repository).  However, it is so simple to use, you should be able to follow using your own Java project as an example.

To create some class files, run this command from the root folder.  If you are using your own project, skip this step; just find the location of your own `.class` files.

```
gradle junderJar
```

Note: if you do not have Gradle installed you can run
```
./gradlew junderJar
```

This command builds class files, but also an unstable version of Junder.  For the tutorial we will use the unstable version, but for your is may be better to get the latest stable version of Junder from [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/codespear/junder/downloads/).

Now we create an file called `my-junder.properties'.  Note that the entries points to the class files generated by the gradle build process.  Obviously if you are using your own Java project you would place different path entries in your properties file.

```
echo "inputPaths=junder.swing/build/classes/main,junder.model/build/classes/main" > my-junder.properties
```

To launch the application, you run this command (or better yet - the stable version you downloaded).

```
java -jar junder.swing/build/libs/junder-unstable.jar my-junder.properties
```

What you will hopefully see is a view with a matrix on the left hand side and an info panel on the right.  Something like this picture:

[![junder-tut-1.png](https://s26.postimg.org/906ewgtop/junder-tut-1.png)](https://postimg.org/image/qdgpbbozp/)

If you click on a coloured cell,  you see some details of the association between the row and column package in the info panel.

The matrix shows the number of times the row package uses the column package.  The info panel shows which classes from these packages are involved in the usage.

The primary use case of the application is to identify the usages that cause dependency loops.  These usages are shown as coloured cells that appear above the diagonal line in the matrix.  

Thus, if you want an application with good dependencies, then you need to aim for a matrix that has no coloured cells above the diagonal.  Obviously Junder is well behaved :-).

## Using the sub-matrix

The sub-matrix view idea is handy when you have a large number of packages and it is difficult to swat is going on something.  A sub-matrix eliminates the packages from the view that is not connected (directly or indirectly) to the package for which the sub-matrix is created.  You can drill into your dependency graph by using the sub-matrix operation recursively; ie.e. create a sub-matrix from a sub-matrix.

A good reason to use the sub-matrix view is when you want to zone into the packages that participate in a cycle.  To do this you would select a coloured cell above the diagonal and create a sub-matrix from it.

To create a sub-matrix choose the action under the `View`menu item (or use the short-cut key).  Note that the `Back to parent matrix` action zooms you back out.

## That's all folks

The application is in its very early stages of development, but it is already a little useful.  Consider yourself invited to propose your ideas on the [issue list](https://bitbucket.org/codespear/junder/issues?status=new&status=open); or even better submit a pull request with an idea already implemented.
